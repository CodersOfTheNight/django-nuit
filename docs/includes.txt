Includes
========

There are a handful of templates available to include for particular functions. These templates can be included using Django's standard template inclusion code.

Loading Animation
-----------------

.. attribute:: 'nuit/includes/loader.html'

    Renders the HTML for a loading animation. Takes two optional arguments:

    .. attribute:: size

        :default: 32

        The size of the loader. There are a number built into Nuit: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, and 96. This is applied by adding a class of ``nuit-loader-sizeXX``, where XX is the defined size. You can use this in your own stylesheets to define your own size styles if necessary.

    .. attribute:: loading_text

        :default: None

        Text to display with the loader. If not set, no text will be displayed.

    Example usage::

        {% include 'nuit/includes/loader.html' with size=64 loading_text='Loading...' %}

Customising with SASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build your own loader classes, use the following SASS mixin::

    .nuit-loader-sizeMASSIVE {
      @include nuit-loader-size(1000px);
    }

This can be imported from ``nuit/_mixins.scss``::

    @import "nuit/_mixins";

You can then reference the size in your templates::

    {% include 'nuit/includes/loader.html' with size='MASSIVE' %}
