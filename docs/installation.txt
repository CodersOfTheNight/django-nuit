Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Nuit is built using SASS_, and requires that you install the SASS binary in order to compile and compress the CSS. This won't be installed using ``pip``, and will need to be installed manually (usually with ``gem install sass``).

Installation
------------

* Install Nuit with ``pip``::

    pip install django-nuit

* Add ``nuit`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'nuit',
        ...
    )

* Add the the following to the end of ``settings.py``::

    from django_autoconfig.autoconfig import configure_settings
    configure_settings(globals())

* For production, add the following settings for django-compressor_ (see their documentation for more detail)::

    COMPRESS_OFFLINE = True

* Run ``collectstatic`` and ``compress`` (``compress`` is only needed if ``COMPRESS_OFFLINE`` is ``True``)::

    manage.py collectstatic
    manage.py compress

* You're now ready to start using Nuit in your templates and apps.

Dependencies
------------

In case you're installing Nuit differently (e.g. from the git repo), make sure to install the following dependencies.

- django_

  Fairly obvious - this is a Django library, afterall::

      pip install django

- django-compressor_

  In order to compile the CSS used by Nuit::

      pip install django-compressor

- django-foundation-statics_

  Nuit provides a suite to tools to help you easily build a consistent front-end interface for your Django application using Zurb's Foundation_ framework. This package contains the static files (CSS, Javscript) that makes up that framework::

      pip install django-foundation-statics

- django-foundation-icons_

  This package contains Zurb's `Foundation Icons`_ static files::

      pip install django-foundation-icons

- django-bourbon_

  This package contains SASS mixins used by Nuit::

      pip install django-bourbon

- django-autoconfig_

  Allows you to include two lines of code in your ``settings.py`` that adds all the required Django settings for Nuit::

      pip install django-autoconfig
