Generic Templates
=================

Nuit's generic templates provide the front-end detail for common operations, such as listing objects. These tend to go hand-in-hand with Django's `Generic Views`_.

.. _`Generic Views`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/

.. _template-generic-list:

``nuit/generic/list.html``
--------------------------

Displays a list of objects, linking to their `detail URL`_, with options for pagination and filtering. This is designed to be used with Nuit's :class:`nuit.views.SearchableListView`.

.. _`detail URL`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/instances/#get-absolute-url

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

The following arguments can be passed to the ``extend`` tag to change the behaviour of the list template:

.. attribute:: base

    :default: 'nuit/base.html'

    Defines the template which :ref:`template-generic-list` will extend. This defaults to :ref:`template-nuit-base`, but in most cases you will have made customisations (such as menu items etc.) to your own base template, and need this template to extend your own.

.. attribute:: search_verb

    :default: 'Search'

    Defines the verb to be displayed on the submit button of the search form, if applicable.

Blocks
^^^^^^

The following blocks can be overridden in subsequent templates to customise the behaviour of the template. All blocks that are included in the template hierarchy are also available - by default, this means all blocks available in :ref:`template-nuit-base`.

.. note::
    
    As always, the best way to override these blocks is to look at the source code for :ref:`template-generic-list`. This will give you a good idea about how Nuit implements parts of the template, and therefore a good indication of what is required if you wish to override the blocks.

.. template-generic-list-block-title:

title
~~~~~

Defines the title of the page, used in an ``<h1>`` element and in the ``<title>``.

.. template-generic-list-block-search-query:

search_query
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays above the list of objects when a search has been performed. Defaults to displaying the number of results and the term that was searched for.

.. template-generic-list-block-object-list:

object_list
~~~~~~~~~~~

Used to override the list of objects. By default, contains an unordered list of the object's ``str`` representations that links to their ``get_absolute_url``.

.. template-generic-400:

``nuit/generic/400.html``
-------------------------

``nuit/generic/403.html``
-------------------------
